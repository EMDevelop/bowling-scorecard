# bowling-scorecard

In this project I will be creating the logic behind a game of bowling for an individual player.

####Â Overview of functionality

- Count & Sum scores of bowling for 1 player
- There are 10 frames
- Each frame, a player tries to knock down 10 pins
- Every frame, player can roll 1 or 2 times
  - depends on strikes / spares
- score = number of pins knocked down + bonuses for strikes / spares
- after every frame, pins are reset

#### Bowling rules

- Strikes

  - Knocking down ALL pins in the FIRST roll
  - The frame ENDS as there are NO MORE PINS
  - the bonus is the number of pins knocked down by the next 2 rolls.
  - That might be the next frame, unless the player rolls another strike

- Spares
  - Knocking down ALL pins in TWO rolls
  - bonus = number of pins knocked down on the next roll (FIRST roll of NEXT frame)
- 10th frame

  - This is the LAST frame
  - If STRIKE or SPARE
    - 10th game can only have 3 ROLLS MAX

- Gutter Game = no pins knocked (20 0 scores)
- Perfect Game = 12 strikes

#### My Approach

I decided to map out the requirements into User Stories, breaking down the various rules and features of the game into testable and client readable step (see `User Stories`).

I have ordered the user stories in terms of complexity, each test will increase in complexity allowing while allowing my tests to be in keeping with the rules of the game.

Tests will provide an accurate assessment of the behavior of my application, I will not be testing specific implementation.
